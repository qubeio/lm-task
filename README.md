## Requirements

Taskmaster utilizes Azure OpenAI for AI-powered task management operations. You will need:

- **Azure OpenAI API key** (Required)
- **Azure OpenAI endpoint** (Required)

This version is specifically configured for corporate environments using Azure OpenAI services.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: MCP (Recommended)

MCP (Model Control Protocol) lets you run Task Master directly from your editor.

#### 1. Add your MCP config at the following path depending on your editor

| Editor       | Scope   | Linux/macOS Path                      | Windows Path                                      | Key          |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Cursor**   | Global  | `~/.cursor/mcp.json`                  | `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json`                  | `mcpServers` |
|              | Project | `<project_folder>/.cursor/mcp.json`   | `<project_folder>\.cursor\mcp.json`               | `mcpServers` |
| **Windsurf** | Global  | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` | `%USERPROFILE%\.codeium\windsurf\mcp_config.json` | `mcpServers` |
| **VS Code**  | Project | `<project_folder>/.vscode/mcp.json`   | `<project_folder>\.vscode\mcp.json`               | `servers`    |

##### Cursor & Windsurf (`mcpServers`)

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "taskmaster-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package=task-master-ai", "task-master-ai"],
      "env": {
        "AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY": "YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE",
        "AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT": "YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT_HERE",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

> üîë Replace `YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE` and `YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT_HERE` with your actual Azure OpenAI
> credentials.

##### VS Code (`servers` + `type`)

```jsonc
{
  "servers": {
    "taskmaster-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package=task-master-ai", "task-master-ai"],
      "env": {
        "AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY": "YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE",
        "AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT": "YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT_HERE",
      },
      "type": "stdio",
    },
  },
}
```

> üîë Replace `YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE` and `YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT_HERE` with your actual Azure OpenAI
> credentials.

#### 2. (Cursor-only) Enable Taskmaster MCP

Open Cursor Settings (Ctrl+Shift+J) ‚û° Click on MCP tab on the left ‚û° Enable task-master-ai with the toggle

#### 3. (Optional) Configure the Azure OpenAI models you want to use

In your editor's AI chat pane, say:

```txt
Configure the main and fallback models to use Azure OpenAI models like gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini.
```

Available Azure OpenAI models include: `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `o3-mini`

#### 4. Initialize Task Master

In your editor's AI chat pane, say:

```txt
Initialize taskmaster-ai in my project
```

#### 5. Make sure you have a PRD in your project root

Task Master will automatically search for PRD files in this order: `PRD.md`, `prd.md`, `PRD.txt`, `prd.txt` in the
project root, then in the `scripts/` directory for backward compatibility.

An example of a PRD is located at `<project_folder>/scripts/example_prd.md` which you can use as a template to create
your `PRD.md` in the project root. A text version is also available at `<project_folder>/scripts/example_prd.txt`.

**Always start with a detailed PRD.**

The more detailed your PRD, the better the generated tasks will be.

#### 6. Common Commands

Use your AI assistant to:

- Parse requirements: `Can you parse my PRD?` (Task Master will automatically find your PRD file)
- Plan next step: `What's the next task I should work on?`
- Implement a task: `Can you help me implement task 3?`
- Add subtasks to a task: `Can you help me add subtasks to task 4?`

### Option 2: Using Command Line

#### Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g task-master-ai

# OR install locally within your project
npm install task-master-ai
```

#### Initialize a new project

```bash
# If installed globally
task-master init

# If installed locally
npx task-master init
```

This will prompt you for project details and set up a new project with the necessary files and structure.

#### Common Commands

```bash
# Initialize a new project
task-master init

# Parse a PRD and generate tasks
task-master parse-prd

# List all tasks
task-master list

# Show the next task to work on
task-master next

# Generate task files
task-master generate
```

## Troubleshooting

### If `task-master init` doesn't respond

Try running it with Node directly:

```bash
node node_modules/claude-task-master/scripts/init.js
```

Or clone the repository and run:

```bash
cd claude-task-master
node scripts/init.js
```
