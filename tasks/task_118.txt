# Task ID: 118
# Title: Improve error message for updating completed subtasks
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the error message when someone tries to update a subtask that is already completed to be more helpful and informative
# Details:
Currently, when someone tries to update a completed subtask, the error message is: "Subtask {id} is already completed and cannot be updated". This should be improved to provide more helpful guidance on what the user can do instead, such as:
1. Explaining why completed subtasks can't be updated
2. Suggesting alternatives like changing status first or creating a new subtask
3. Providing the current status and title for context
4. Making the message more user-friendly
