# Task ID: 106
# Title: Switch TUI to Direct Task JSON Querying
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the TUI so that it reads and parses tasks directly from tasks.json, instead of relying on CLI command output. This ensures all fields (such as 'details') are available to the UI and improves reliability. Update all relevant screens and data-fetching logic to use direct file access. Add robust error handling and update documentation/tests as needed.
