# Task ID: 119
# Title: Restore update task functionality with manual details update
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: The regular task update functionality (update-task command) has been disabled and shows a message about AI-powered functionality being removed. Implement a simple manual update mechanism for task details similar to the subtask update functionality.
# Details:
Currently, the update-task functionality in scripts/modules/task-manager/update-task-by-id.js just returns a message saying "AI-powered task update functionality has been removed". This should be restored with a manual approach similar to what was implemented for subtasks:

1. Allow users to manually append details to existing task details with timestamps
2. Implement validation to prevent updating completed tasks (similar to subtasks)
3. Provide helpful error messages when trying to update completed tasks
4. Update both CLI and MCP interfaces
5. Follow the same pattern as update-subtask-by-id.js for consistency

Key files to update:
- scripts/modules/task-manager/update-task-by-id.js (core logic)
- mcp-server/src/core/direct-functions/update-task-by-id.js (MCP wrapper)
- Both CLI and MCP tools should work consistently

Testing the restored update task functionality after MCP server restart.

Implementation completed:
1. ✅ Updated scripts/modules/task-manager/update-task-by-id.js - Replaced AI-powered functionality with manual timestamped detail appending
2. ✅ Updated mcp-server/src/core/direct-functions/update-task-by-id.js - Modified MCP wrapper to handle details parameter
3. ✅ Updated mcp-server/src/tools/update-task.js - Added details parameter to MCP tool

The manual update functionality now works similar to subtask updates:
- Validates task ID and details parameters
- Prevents updating completed tasks (status 'done' or 'completed')
- Appends timestamped details to existing task details
- Generates task files after update
- Provides helpful CLI output with next steps
- Follows same error handling pattern as subtask updates
