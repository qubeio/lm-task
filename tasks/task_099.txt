# Task ID: 99
# Title: Refactor PRD to use Markdown Format in Root Directory
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the application to use a Product Requirements Document (PRD) in Markdown format (e.g., `PRD.md`) located in the project's root directory. This replaces the current `scripts/prd.txt`.
# Details:
1. Update PRD parsing logic to correctly interpret Markdown syntax.
2. Change the expected PRD filename convention (e.g., from `prd.txt` to `PRD.md`).
3. Modify all code referencing the PRD path to look for it in the project root directory instead of the `scripts/` subdirectory.
4. Ensure tools like `parse_prd` and project initialization scripts are updated to reflect these changes.
5. Document the new PRD format and location requirements.
6. Consider backward compatibility or provide clear migration steps for existing projects if applicable.

# Test Strategy:
1. Create a sample `PRD.md` file in the root directory with various Markdown elements.
2. Run the `parse_prd` tool (or equivalent function) and verify it correctly processes the Markdown PRD from the root directory.
3. Confirm that tasks are generated accurately based on the content of `PRD.md`.
4. Test project initialization to ensure it correctly sets up or expects the PRD in the new location/format.
5. Verify that any other system components relying on PRD information function correctly with the changes.
