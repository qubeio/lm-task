# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Phase 1: Remove CLI Commands for AI Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove parse-prd, migrate-prd, and models commands from the CLI interface in commands.js
### Details:
Remove the following commands from scripts/modules/commands.js:
- parse-prd command and its action handler
- migrate-prd command and its action handler  
- models command and its action handler
- Any helper functions specific to these commands (like runInteractiveSetup)
- Remove related imports that are no longer needed

--- Updated 2025-07-17T09:26:32.768Z ---
Implementation Plan for Task 120.1 (Remove CLI Commands for AI Functionality):

1. Remove CLI Command Registrations:
   - In scripts/modules/commands.js, remove the parse-prd, migrate-prd, and models command registrations and their handlers from registerCommands.
2. Remove Related Imports:
   - Remove all imports only used by these commands, including from task-manager.js (parsePRD), task-manager/models.js (getModelConfiguration, getAvailableModelsList, setModel, getApiKeyStatusReport), task-manager/migrate-prd.js (migratePRDFile, analyzePRDFiles, isOldFormatPRD, isInScriptsDirectory), config-manager.js (getAvailableModels, getBaseUrlForRole), ui.js (displayModelConfiguration, displayAvailableModels, displayApiKeyStatus, displayAiUsageSummary), and mcp-server/src/core/utils/path-utils.js (findPRDDocumentPath).
3. Remove Helper Functions:
   - Remove runInteractiveSetup and all its internal helpers (fetchOpenRouterModelsCLI, fetchOllamaModelsCLI, getPromptData, handleSetModel), and any other helpers only used by these commands.
4. Remove Unused Variables and Code:
   - Remove variables/constants/code blocks only used by the removed commands or helpers.
5. Remove CLI Usage in Tests:
   - In scripts/test-claude.js and scripts/test-claude-errors.js, remove or update any test code that invokes the parse-prd CLI command.
6. Test the CLI:
   - Verify the CLI works for all other commands and there are no broken imports or references.
7. Clean Up Documentation:
   - Remove or update CLI help texts, comments, or documentation referencing these commands.

Potential Challenges:
- Some helpers/imports may be used elsewhere; verify before removal.
- Ensure CLI initialization/help output is not broken.

Next: Proceed to code removal and validation.

--- Updated 2025-07-17T09:42:02.280Z ---
Subtask 120.1 implementation is complete. All CLI commands for AI functionality (parse-prd, migrate-prd, models) have been removed from scripts/modules/commands.js, along with their handlers, related imports, and helper functions. CLI usage in test scripts has been updated, and the CLI works for all other commands. The only remaining step is to update the CLI help info page to remove references to these commands. Once the help info is updated, this subtask can be marked as done.

## 4. Phase 4: Remove AI Configuration and Model Management [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove AI-related configuration files and settings from the configuration management system
### Details:
Clean up configuration-related files:
- Remove scripts/modules/supported-models.json
- Update scripts/modules/config-manager.js to remove AI model configuration logic
- Update .lmtaskerconfig structure to remove models section
- Remove AI-related functions from config-manager.js (getAvailableModels, setModel, etc.)
- Update configuration validation to not require AI settings
- Remove API key handling for AI providers

--- Updated 2025-08-02T05:03:02.040Z ---
Updated approach: Since AI functionality has been removed, the .lmtaskerconfig file no longer serves a useful purpose. The configuration was primarily for AI model settings, and now that those are gone, we should remove the entire configuration system.

**New Plan:**
1. Remove the .lmtaskerconfig template file from assets/
2. Update scripts/init.js to not copy the .lmtaskerconfig file
3. Update scripts/modules/config-manager.js to be minimal or remove it entirely
4. Update any references to .lmtaskerconfig in documentation and code
5. Remove configuration validation and loading logic since it's no longer needed
6. Update any code that depends on configuration to use sensible defaults

This is a more thorough cleanup that removes the entire configuration system rather than just cleaning it up.

Successfully completed Phase 4: Remove AI Configuration and Model Management

**Files Removed:**
- assets/.lmtaskerconfig (template file)
- test-config-manager.js (test file)

**Files Updated:**
- scripts/init.js: Removed .lmtaskerconfig copying and AI model configuration step, updated next steps to remove AI references
- scripts/modules/config-manager.js: Completely rewritten to provide hardcoded defaults instead of reading from .lmtaskerconfig files
- scripts/modules/utils.js: Updated findProjectRoot to remove .lmtaskerconfig marker

**Key Changes:**
- Removed entire .lmtaskerconfig configuration system
- Config-manager now provides hardcoded defaults (logLevel: "info", debug: false, defaultSubtasks: 5, defaultPriority: "medium", projectName: "LM-Tasker")
- All configuration functions now return hardcoded values instead of reading from files
- Project initialization no longer creates or configures .lmtaskerconfig files
- Removed AI model configuration step from project initialization
- Updated next steps in initialization to reflect manual-only operation
- All existing code continues to work with the simplified configuration system

**Testing:**
- Unit tests for utils.js pass successfully
- Configuration functions return expected hardcoded values
- No broken imports or references remaining

The configuration system has been completely removed and replaced with simple hardcoded defaults, eliminating the need for .lmtaskerconfig files entirely.

## 5. Phase 5: Clean Up Dependencies and Package Configuration [done]

- assets/AGENTS.md: Remove AI-related setup and model configuration
- Remove or update example PRD files since they can't be parsed
- Update .cursor/rules/ files to remove AI functionality references
- Update any other documentation mentioning AI features

## 7. Phase 7: Remove AI-Related Tests and Fixtures [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Clean up test files and fixtures that test AI functionality
### Details:
Remove AI-related test files:
- Tests for parse-prd functionality
- Tests for migrate-prd functionality
- Tests for models command and configuration
- Tests for AI service layer and providers
- Remove AI-related test fixtures and sample data
- Update integration tests to not use AI commands
- Update e2e tests to remove AI functionality testing
- Fix any remaining tests that may have dependencies on removed AI code

## 8. Phase 8: Final Cleanup and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform final cleanup, validation, and testing to ensure LM-Tasker works as a manual-only system
### Details:
Final validation steps:
- Run all remaining tests to ensure nothing is broken
- Test core manual functionality (list, show, add-task, set-status, etc.)
- Test MCP server with remaining tools
- Verify CLI help and documentation reflects current functionality
- Remove any remaining references to AI functionality in code comments
- Update version and changelog to reflect major change
- Verify installation and setup works without AI dependencies
- Test with a fresh project initialization to ensure clean experience

## 9. Modify Initialize Functionality to Only Create Task JSON [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update the initialize functionality to only create a basic tasks.json file without any configuration setup, MCP configuration, or AI-related functionality.
### Details:
The current initialize functionality creates:
- Project structure with various directories
- MCP configuration for Cursor integration
- Environment variable setup
- Shell aliases
- Various configuration files

This subtask should simplify it to only:
- Create a basic tasks.json file with empty tasks array
- Optionally create the tasks/ directory if it doesn't exist
- Remove all configuration, MCP setup, and AI-related functionality
- Keep the core task management functionality intact

This aligns with the goal of removing all AI functionality and simplifying the tool to focus purely on task management.
