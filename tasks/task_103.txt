# Task ID: 103
# Title: TUI Theme Tweaking and Visual Improvements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 102
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refine the visual aesthetics of the TaskMaster TUI interface by adjusting colors, borders, spacing, and other minor elements to improve the overall user experience.
# Details:
Review the current TUI implementation (from Task 102) and identify visual inconsistencies, such as non-uniform spacing, color clashes, or misaligned borders. Update the styling configuration to include a refreshed color palette and standardized spacing and border styles. Ensure that the layout is responsive and the improvements do not negatively impact usability or performance. Consider adding light/dark mode toggling options if time permits, and include code examples and documentation to assist in future TUI style updates.

# Test Strategy:
Perform manual testing in various terminal sizes and color schemes to verify that the updated visual elements render correctly. Run automated visual regression tests, checking that the new style configurations are applied consistently. Conduct user experience reviews to gather feedback on the visual improvements, and include test cases to ensure that both normal and edge cases (e.g., minimal terminal sizes) display appropriately.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Pale Pink Highlight Color for TUI [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Change the highlight color in the TUI from dark blue to a very pale pink. The new color should be soft and not overly bright to maintain a professional look. This involves updating the theme configuration file where the selected background color is defined.
### Details:

Implementation completed: The theme.js file was updated to change the selected background color from "blue" to "#fdf2f8" (a very pale pink), and both selectedText and selectedFg were changed from "white" to "black" for improved contrast. These changes ensure consistency across all UI components, including TaskTable row selection, SearchScreen focus border, and TaskDetailScreen subtask selection. All references to theme.selected, theme.selectedText, theme.selectedBg, and theme.selectedFg now use the new pale pink color scheme, providing a soft, professional highlight effect throughout the interface.
