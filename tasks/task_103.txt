# Task ID: 103
# Title: TUI Theme Tweaking and Visual Improvements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 102
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refine the visual aesthetics of the TaskMaster TUI interface by adjusting colors, borders, spacing, and other minor elements to improve the overall user experience.
# Details:
Review the current TUI implementation (from Task 102) and identify visual inconsistencies, such as non-uniform spacing, color clashes, or misaligned borders. Update the styling configuration to include a refreshed color palette and standardized spacing and border styles. Ensure that the layout is responsive and the improvements do not negatively impact usability or performance. Consider adding light/dark mode toggling options if time permits, and include code examples and documentation to assist in future TUI style updates.

# Test Strategy:
Perform manual testing in various terminal sizes and color schemes to verify that the updated visual elements render correctly. Run automated visual regression tests, checking that the new style configurations are applied consistently. Conduct user experience reviews to gather feedback on the visual improvements, and include test cases to ensure that both normal and edge cases (e.g., minimal terminal sizes) display appropriately.
