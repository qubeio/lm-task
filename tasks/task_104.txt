# Task ID: 104
# Title: Implement Exit Confirmation Dialog for TUI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 102, 103
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a reusable exit confirmation dialog component for the TaskMaster TUI that displays a confirmation prompt when the user presses escape.
# Details:
Design and implement a modal popup that is triggered when the user presses the escape key in the TUI. The popup should display the message 'Are you sure you want to exit? (y/N)' and allow the user to confirm exit with 'y' or 'Y', or cancel with 'n', 'N', or additional escape key press, with the enter key defaulting to cancel. The component must use the existing theme colors and styling as defined in Task 103, and be a reusable module callable from the main TUI app. Ensure proper handling of keyboard navigation, focus restoration to the previous interface when cancelled, and robust error handling for unexpected inputs.

# Test Strategy:
Manually test by triggering the modal via escape key in the TUI to ensure it appears as expected with proper styling. Verify that pressing 'y' or 'Y' exits the application, while pressing 'n', 'N', escape, or enter (without valid input) properly cancels the exit and returns focus to the previous screen. Perform cross-terminal testing to validate consistency in rendering and keyboard event handling.
