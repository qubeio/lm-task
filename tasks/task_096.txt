# Title: Verify JSON Parsing After Server Restart
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 23, 95
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an automated test to ensure that the JSON parsing fix remains effective after the MCP server restarts.
# Details:
Develop a comprehensive testing strategy that simulates a server restart and verifies that JSON parsing works as expected. The test should programmatically restart the server, load various JSON payloads (including valid, malformed, and edge-case inputs), and monitor the server's log outputs and responses for correct parsing behavior. Steps include:
• Triggering a controlled server restart using the MCP server's restart procedures.
• Injecting a series of test JSON files (with well-formed and intentionally malformed data) into the system.
• Verifying that the server processes valid JSON correctly and logs appropriate error messages for malformatted JSON.
• Ensuring that fallback/error handling mechanisms activate as intended upon detecting malformed JSON.
• Integrating these tests into an automated testing suite (using frameworks like Mocha or Jest) and ensuring they run as part of the CI pipeline.
• Documenting each scenario and its expected outcome to facilitate future debugging and maintenance.

# Test Strategy:
Set up a controlled test environment and create sample JSON files representing various cases. Execute the tests by restarting the server programmatically and verifying, via log analysis and assertions in the testing framework, that: 1) Valid JSON is parsed and loaded correctly; 2) Errors are logged properly for malformed JSON inputs; and 3) Appropriate recovery measures are enacted without server downtime. Confirm that the test suite passes with all expected outcomes.
