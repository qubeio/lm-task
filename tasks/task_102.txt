# Task ID: 102
# Title: Implement TaskMaster TUI for Task Management
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an interactive terminal user interface using Blessed.js for managing tasks by integrating with existing CLI commands.
# Details:
Set up a TUI launched via the 'tmui' command that displays tasks in a format consistent with 'tm list'. This TUI should use Blessed.js for its layout and support Vim-style navigation (j/k for up/down, gg/G for top/bottom). Integrate a search feature with forward slash (/) that highlights matches, and allow users to view task details with the Enter key, equivalent to the 'tm show <id>' command. Use a CLI adapter (CliAdapter class) to call existing CLI commands and parse JSON output. The implementation should be modular, with components like TaskListScreen, TaskDetailScreen, and SearchScreen, and follow the phased approach from MVP foundation to enhanced UI and interactive features as outlined in the design document at docs/tui-design.md.

# Test Strategy:
Launch the application using the 'tmui' command and verify that the task list loads correctly in the expected format. Test navigation keys (j/k and gg/G) and ensure search functionality is activated via '/' with proper result highlighting. Confirm that pressing Enter opens the detailed view of a selected task, and that pressing 'q' exits the TUI. Also, verify that CLI commands are correctly executed under the hood, and validate that all components interact as expected.

Investigate and debug the data flow for displaying task details:
- Trace how getCurrentTask() determines and passes the task ID
- Verify cliAdapter.getTask() correctly parses the JSON response from the CLI
- Ensure TaskDetailScreen.setTask() receives and renders the correct task data
- Add logging or assertions at each step to identify where data may be lost or misparsed
- Confirm that the task detail screen accurately reflects the data returned by the CLI

<info added on 2025-06-07T17:20:49.229Z>
Resolved JSON parsing issues caused by CLI banners, update notifications, and debug logs contaminating output. Updated CLI to suppress banners and notifications when --json is used, and disabled debug logging for JSON output. Verified that task details are now correctly parsed and displayed in the TaskDetailScreen when Enter is pressed, with clean JSON returned from the CLI.

<info added on 2025-06-07T18:13:35.265Z>
Redesigned TaskDetailScreen layout implemented:
- Parent task info displayed at the top 30% of the screen
- Subtask list shown on the left (bottom 70%, 50% width)
- Subtask detail pane on the right (bottom 70%, 50% width)
- Status bar added with navigation instructions
- j/k keys enable navigation between subtasks with visual selection highlighting

Minor outstanding issue: Subtask detail pane text formatting needs improvement, as text is currently cut off or not properly wrapped, likely due to padding or wrapping settings in the detail box.

<info added on 2025-06-07T18:24:53.486Z>
Fixed subtask details display issues:

- Resolved subtask ID formatting to correctly display dotted notation (e.g., "102.9" instead of "1029") by adding explicit String() conversion in subtask header and list, updating both updateSubtaskDetail() and updateSubtaskList().
- Eliminated stray "e" character and other visual artifacts by commenting out DEBUG console.log statements in cliAdapter.js and app.js, ensuring clean terminal output.
- Improved dependencies display: now shows "None" when no dependencies exist and removed brackets around dependency IDs for a cleaner look.
- Verified that subtask details now display correct IDs, clean formatting, and consistent status/priority information.

All major subtask details display issues are resolved and the TaskDetailScreen is ready for final testing and validation.

Resolved duplicate key input issue in the search box by removing the conflicting keypress event handler and switching to a polling-based real-time search using setInterval. SearchScreen now starts polling the textbox value every 200ms on focus and stops polling on blur, hide, or clear, ensuring single keystrokes are registered correctly. Updated SearchScreen.setupEventHandlers() to use focus/blur events, and added startRealTimeSearch() and stopRealTimeSearch() methods for interval management. Real-time search remains functional without duplicate character input.

<info added on 2025-06-07T22:37:49.932Z>
Applied targeted fix for duplicate key handling in the search textbox:

- Identified that setting `keys: true` on the textbox caused conflicts with global key handlers, resulting in duplicate keystroke processing.
- Updated SearchScreen textbox configuration to use `keys: false` while retaining `inputOnFocus: true` for proper text input.
- Removed the textbox-specific escape key handler, relying instead on the global escape handler in KeyHandlers.js.
- This change ensures the textbox only processes text input, while navigation and special keys are handled globally, eliminating duplicate character input without impacting other functionality.

<info added on 2025-06-07T22:39:48.800Z>
Implemented comprehensive fix for duplicate key handling by isolating global key handlers during search mode. Introduced disableGlobalKeys() to temporarily remove all global keypress handlers when the search UI is shown, and enableGlobalKeys() to restore them when search is hidden. Restored keys: true on the search textbox, as global interference is now prevented. Added a dedicated escape key handler active only during search mode. Original key handlers are saved in a savedKeyHandlers property and properly restored after search, with KeyHandlers re-initialized to ensure correct application state. This approach fully separates search input from global key processing, eliminating duplicate input issues while preserving all other app functionality.

Scope is limited to status updates only‚Äîno editing of task titles, descriptions, or details. Only three status options are supported: "pending", "in-progress", and "done". Implement a simple status toggle feature with a key binding (e.g., 's') in the TaskListScreen, opening a minimal modal for status selection. Integrate with updateTaskStatus() in the CLI adapter, ensuring immediate visual feedback and task list refresh. Exclude text editing, complex status options, bulk operations, and undo functionality to maintain a clean, focused UI.
