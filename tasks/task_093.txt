# Task ID: 93
# Title: Remove Expansion Functionality and Complexity Analysis Features
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Eliminate all expansion commands, related MCP tools, function wrappers, and complexity analysis features from Task Master since Cursor LLM now handles subtask creation more effectively.
# Details:
• Remove all references to the expand-task and expand-all-tasks commands from the CLI codebase and associated documentation. 
• Identify and delete any MCP tools and direct function wrappers that were specifically built to support the expansion functionality. 
• Remove complexity analysis features that were implemented primarily for the expand functionality. 
• Audit the entire codebase and documentation for any residual or indirect references to task expansion, and remove or update them accordingly. 
• Verify that the new Cursor LLM integration (from Task 13) handles subtask creation without dependency on the removed code, ensuring that no breaking changes occur in the task workflow.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that CLI commands related to task expansion are no longer available and do not appear in help outputs. 
2. Review code to confirm that all direct function wrappers and MCP tools supporting expansion have been removed. 
3. Check documentation and user guides to ensure that all references to expand functionality and complexity analysis have been updated or removed. 
4. Run integration tests to validate that subtask creation now exclusively leverages Cursor LLM integration (Task 13) without errors or performance degradation. 
5. Confirm that no residual code or warnings related to the removed features are present in the build outputs.
