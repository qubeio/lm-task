# Task ID: 114
# Title: Implement Vim-Style Left and Right Navigation in TUI
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add vim-style h/l key bindings for left and right navigation in the LM-Tasker TUI interface, providing an intuitive navigation experience for vim users.
# Details:
Implement vim-style navigation keys in the TUI:
- 'h' key for left navigation (go back/previous screen)
- 'l' key for right navigation (go forward/enter details)
- Update key handlers in the TUI components to support these bindings
- Ensure the new bindings work alongside existing navigation methods
- Test in both task list and task detail screens
- Update any help text or documentation to reflect the new key bindings

Technical implementation:
- Update keyHandlers.js to include h/l key mappings
- Modify TaskListScreen.js and TaskDetailScreen.js to handle the new keys
- Ensure proper integration with existing navigation logic
- Add appropriate visual feedback for the navigation actions

# Test Strategy:
Manual testing of vim-style navigation:
1. Launch TUI and verify 'h' key navigates back/left
2. Verify 'l' key navigates forward/right or enters details
3. Test in both task list and detail screens
4. Confirm existing navigation methods still work
5. Verify help text shows new key bindings if applicable

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze current navigation architecture and plan vim-style implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document the current navigation system and create a detailed implementation plan for adding h/l key bindings
### Details:
## Current Navigation Architecture Analysis

### Key Components:
1. **KeyHandlers.js**: Centralized keyboard event handling for global keys
2. **TaskListScreen.js**: Main task list view 
3. **TaskDetailScreen.js**: Task detail view with local key handlers
4. **App.js**: Main application with screen management (showTaskList, showTaskDetail)

### Current Navigation Flow:
- **Task List → Task Detail**: Enter key (handled in KeyHandlers.js)
- **Task Detail → Task List**: Escape/q keys (handled in TaskDetailScreen.js)

### Implementation Plan for Vim-Style h/l Navigation:

#### 1. In KeyHandlers.js (Global Navigation):
- Add 'l' key binding: Navigate forward/enter details (same as Enter)
- Add 'h' key binding: Navigate back (context-sensitive)
  - In task list: Do nothing (already at top level)
  - In task detail: Return to task list

#### 2. In TaskDetailScreen.js (Local Navigation):
- Add 'h' key binding to all component key handlers (container, subtaskList, parentTaskBox, subtaskDetailBox)
- Map 'h' to return to task list (same as escape/q)
- Add 'l' key binding for potential future navigation within detail view

#### 3. Update Help Text:
- Modify showHelp() method in KeyHandlers.js to include h/l bindings
- Update both "Navigation" and "Task Detail View" sections

#### 4. Testing Strategy:
- Test 'l' key in task list (should enter task details)
- Test 'h' key in task detail (should return to task list)  
- Test 'h' key in task list (should do nothing)
- Verify existing navigation still works
- Test in different focus states within task detail view

### Technical Implementation Details:
- Use same event handling pattern as existing keys
- Ensure proper context checking (current screen, focus state)
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing navigation
- Add visual feedback where appropriate

## 2. Implement h/l key bindings in KeyHandlers.js [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add vim-style h (left/back) and l (right/forward) key bindings to the global key handlers
### Details:
Add h/l key bindings to the setup() method in KeyHandlers.js:
- 'l' key: Navigate forward (same as Enter key behavior)
- 'h' key: Navigate back (context-sensitive based on current screen)
- Ensure proper context checking to avoid conflicts
- Maintain existing functionality

## 3. Add h/l key bindings to TaskDetailScreen.js [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add vim-style h/l key bindings to all key handler components in TaskDetailScreen for consistent navigation
### Details:
Add h/l key bindings to all component key handlers in TaskDetailScreen.js:
- container key handlers
- subtaskList key handlers  
- parentTaskBox key handlers
- subtaskDetailBox key handlers

Map 'h' to return to task list (same as escape/q)
Map 'l' for potential future navigation within detail view
Ensure consistency across all focus states

## 4. Test vim-style navigation implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Manually test the implemented vim-style h/l navigation keys to ensure they work correctly in all contexts
### Details:
Manual testing checklist:
1. Launch TUI and verify 'l' key navigates from task list to task details
2. Verify 'h' key navigates from task details back to task list  
3. Test 'h' key in task list (should do nothing - no error)
4. Test navigation in different focus states within task detail view
5. Verify existing navigation methods (Enter, Escape, q) still work
6. Check that help text shows new key bindings correctly
7. Test that keys don't interfere with search mode or status modal
8. Verify vim-style navigation works alongside existing j/k/gg/G keys
