# Task ID: 113
# Title: Update Documentation to Reflect Reduced AI Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Update all documentation files in the docs/ folder to accurately reflect the simplified architecture with AI limited to PRD parsing only, removing references to deprecated AI-powered features and updating examples accordingly.
# Details:
Based on the PRD.md changes, the documentation needs to be updated to reflect the new simplified architecture where:

1. AI functionality is limited to PRD parsing only
2. All task operations (add, update, modify) are manual via CLI/MCP
3. Package has been rebranded from task-master-ai to lm-tasker
4. Configuration uses .lmtaskerconfig instead of .lmtaskerconfig
5. Binary commands changed from task-master to lm-tasker

Key files to update:
- docs/command-reference.md: Remove AI-powered task creation/update references, update command names
- docs/configuration.md: Update config file names and focus on PRD parsing model configuration
- docs/examples.md: Update examples to reflect manual task management workflow
- docs/tutorial.md: Update tutorial to emphasize manual task operations
- docs/models.md: Clarify that models are only used for PRD parsing
- docs/task-structure.md: Update to reflect manual task management approach

The documentation should clearly communicate that:
- Task creation, updates, and modifications are manual operations
- AI is only used for initial PRD-to-tasks conversion
- This provides predictable behavior and lower costs
- The system focuses on structured task management rather than AI automation

# Test Strategy:
Review all updated documentation files to ensure:
1. No references to deprecated AI-powered task operations remain
2. All command examples use lm-tasker instead of task-master
3. Configuration examples reference .lmtaskerconfig
4. Examples and workflows reflect manual task management
5. AI usage is clearly scoped to PRD parsing only
6. Documentation is consistent with the PRD.md architecture
