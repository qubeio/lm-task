      "details": "Scope:\n- File under tests/unit/mcp/tools/get-tasks.test.js\n- Cover: (1) registration: name, parameters; (2) execute happy path delegates to direct function with correct args; (3) handles status and withSubtasks parameters; (4) propagates errors and returns structured failure output.\n- Mock direct function module only; avoid deep mocks.\nImpact:\n- Improves coverage for get-tasks.js (currently single-digit) and ensures stable MCP tool API.\n\n--- Updated 2025-10-03T19:23:15.855Z ---\nImplemented wrapper tests for MCP tool get-tasks.\n- Files added: tests/unit/mcp/tools/get-tasks.test.js\n- Covered: tool registration shape; execute happy path delegating to listTasksDirect with normalized args; error path when findTasksJsonPath fails\n- Result: get-tasks.js coverage significantly improved; tests passing",
