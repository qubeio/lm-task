      "details": "Enhance the task management system by extending the task schema with an optional 'order' field for display positioning. Develop the following functions:\n- insert-task: Shifts existing tasks' order values to insert a new task at a specific position.\n- insert-between: Determines a fractional position between tasks to facilitate insertion without disrupting order continuity.\n- reorder-task: Allows existing tasks to be moved to new positions by updating their order values.\n- migrate-order: Automatically migrate the system from relying on ID-based sorting to order-based sorting while maintaining backward compatibility.\n\nIntegrate these functionalities with CLI commands (insert-task, insert-between, reorder-task, migrate-order) and create corresponding MCP tools. Adhere to the 5-phase approach from the planning document, starting with core infrastructure, then inserting, reordering, integrating with MCP, and final polish. Incorporate comprehensive error handling to manage invalid inputs and ensure smooth operation alongside legacy functionality.",

Unit Test each function: Verify that insert-task correctly shifts order values and places the new task at the specified position; test insert-between for correct fractional positioning; test reorder-task to ensure tasks can be moved successfully; and validate migrate-order for accurate conversion from ID-based to order-based sorting. \n2. CLI Integration Tests: Execute each new CLI command to ensure they trigger the expected functionality and handle errors gracefully. \n3. Regression Testing: Run existing task operations to confirm backward compatibility is maintained. \n4. Edge Cases: Test boundary conditions such as inserting at the beginning, middle, or end of the task list, and ensure error messages for invalid order inputs are descriptive and helpful.",

The local MCP server configuration is working perfectly\n2. The update subtask functionality has been fully restored\n3. Both CLI and MCP interfaces can handle the task.subtask numbering system\n4. The manual details update mechanism is functioning correctly\n\nThe issue with the previous test was that we were trying to update completed subtasks (117.1 and 117.2 were marked as 'done'), and the system correctly prevents updating completed tasks.\n\nThis test on a pending subtask (105.1) proves that our fix is working perfectly! ðŸš€",

Core Function (`scripts/modules/task-manager/update-subtask-by-id.js`)\n- Replace the disabled function with a simple manual update mechanism\n- Accept subtask ID in format \"parentId.subtaskId\" (e.g., \"105.1\")\n- Allow appending timestamped details to existing subtask details\n- Handle both CLI and MCP contexts\n\n### 2. CLI Command Integration\n- The CLI command is already registered in `scripts/modules/commands.js`\n- Ensure it properly handles the --details parameter\n- Provide clear user feedback\n\n### 3. MCP Tool Integration\n- The MCP tool structure is already in place\n- Ensure proper parameter handling for the details field\n- Add details parameter to the MCP tool schema\n\n### 4. Implementation Approach\n- Read tasks.json and find the specified subtask\n- Append new details with timestamp to existing details\n- Write back to tasks.json\n- Regenerate task files\n- Return success/failure status\n\n### 5. Error Handling\n- Validate subtask ID format (must contain dot)\n- Ensure parent task exists\n- Ensure subtask exists within parent\n- Handle file read/write errors\n\nThis approach maintains the existing API while providing a simple, reliable way to update subtask details manually.\n\n--- Updated 2025-07-03T13:56:29.313Z ---\nTesting the restored functionality\n\n--- Updated 2025-07-03T13:56:49.332Z ---\nTesting the restored functionality\n\n--- Updated 2025-07-03T13:59:08.228Z ---\nTesting local MCP server setup - the fix is complete and ready for testing",
