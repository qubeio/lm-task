# Task ID: 94
# Title: Implement Watch Mode for List and Show Commands
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the 'task-master list' and 'task-master show' commands by adding a '--watch' flag that enables live updates, similar to Kubernetes watch functionality.
# Details:
Develop a watch mode that, when the --watch flag is enabled, continuously displays the current output (task list or task details) and automatically refreshes the view when the tasks.json file is modified. This mode should clear the screen between refreshes, display a timestamp of the last update, and listen for a Ctrl+C interrupt to exit the watch mode. Implementation should include: 

1. Modifying the list and show command handlers to check for the '--watch' flag. 
2. Implementing a polling mechanism that checks the file modification time of tasks.json every 2-3 seconds. 
3. Building in error handling to gracefully manage scenarios where tasks.json is temporarily unavailable. 
4. Using efficient file system event detection (or fallback polling) to reduce overhead. 
5. Enhancing the UI with clear visual feedback that watch mode is active, including periodic clear screen functionality and timestamp updates.

Consider reusing or integrating with existing CLI infrastructure from Task 2 (CLI Foundation) and the basic task retrieval functionalities from Task 3 (Basic Task Operations). Ensure that the code is modular to allow easy updates and maintenance.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that when the --watch flag is specified with the list or show commands, the current output is displayed and automatically refreshes every 2-3 seconds after modifications to tasks.json. Confirm that the screen is cleared before each update and a valid timestamp is displayed. Simulate file inaccessibility and ensure that the system handles errors gracefully without crashing, and that the user can exit the watch mode by pressing Ctrl+C.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Extend CLI Command Parsers to Support '--watch' Flag [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update the 'list' and 'show' command handlers to recognize and parse the '--watch' flag, ensuring it is passed correctly to the underlying logic.
### Details:
Modify scripts/modules/commands.js to update the argument parsing logic for 'task-master list' and 'task-master show'. Ensure the '--watch' flag is detected and a corresponding boolean is passed to the command execution functions. Update help text and usage documentation to reflect the new flag.

## 2. Refactor List and Show Handlers to Accept Watch Mode [pending]
### Dependencies: 94.1
### Description: Refactor the core logic of the list and show command handlers to accept a watch mode parameter and branch execution accordingly.
### Details:
In scripts/modules/commands.js, update the list and show handler functions to accept a 'watch' parameter. If watch mode is enabled, delegate to a new watch handler; otherwise, proceed with the standard output logic. Ensure code remains modular and testable.

## 3. Implement File Change Detection Utility [pending]
### Dependencies: 94.2
### Description: Develop a utility function in scripts/modules/utils.js to detect changes to tasks.json using efficient file system event detection (fs.watch) with a fallback to polling.
### Details:
Create a reusable function that accepts a file path and a callback, using fs.watch for event-based detection and falling back to polling (setInterval with fs.stat) if necessary. Ensure the utility is robust and handles cross-platform differences.

## 4. Develop Watch Mode Loop for List and Show Commands [pending]
### Dependencies: 94.3
### Description: Implement the core watch loop that repeatedly fetches and displays task data when changes are detected, with a refresh interval of 2-3 seconds.
### Details:
Create a watch loop function that uses the file change detection utility to trigger data reloads. On each change, clear the screen, fetch the latest data, and display it. Ensure the loop can be interrupted gracefully.

## 5. Integrate Error Handling for Unavailable tasks.json [pending]
### Dependencies: 94.4
### Description: Enhance the watch loop with error handling to gracefully manage scenarios where tasks.json is temporarily missing or unreadable.
### Details:
Wrap file read operations in try/catch blocks. If tasks.json is unavailable, display a user-friendly error message and retry on the next interval. Ensure the watch mode does not crash and recovers when the file becomes available again.

## 6. Enhance Watch Mode UI with Clear Screen and Timestamp [pending]
### Dependencies: 94.5
### Description: Improve the watch mode user interface to clear the terminal between refreshes, display a timestamp of the last update, and indicate that watch mode is active.
### Details:
Use process.stdout.write and ANSI escape codes to clear the terminal. Display a formatted timestamp and a clear 'Watch Mode Active' banner at the top of each refresh. Integrate with any existing UI utilities for consistent styling.

## 7. Implement Ctrl+C Interrupt Handling for Watch Mode [pending]
### Dependencies: 94.6
### Description: Add logic to listen for SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and exit watch mode cleanly, restoring the terminal state.
### Details:
Register a process.on('SIGINT') handler within the watch loop to break out of the loop, perform any necessary cleanup, and display a friendly exit message. Ensure no orphaned timers or listeners remain.

## 8. Integrate and Test Watch Mode with Existing CLI and Task Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 94.7
### Description: Ensure the new watch mode integrates seamlessly with the CLI foundation and basic task retrieval logic, following modular design principles.
### Details:
Review and refactor as needed to ensure the watch mode code is modular, reusable, and consistent with the CLI and task operation modules. Write integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality for both list and show commands in watch mode.
