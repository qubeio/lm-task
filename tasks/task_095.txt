# Task ID: 95
# Title: Revise .windsurfrules for MCP Server Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 86
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the .windsurfrules file to shift focus from CLI operations to MCP server functionality, aligning with the new configuration and workflow paradigms.
# Details:
Refactor the .windsurfrules file by modifying the DEV_WORKFLOW section to prioritize MCP tools over traditional CLI commands. Replace all CLI command examples with their MCP equivalents and add sections that detail MCP-specific configuration, setup guidance, and server restart procedures when core logic changes occur. Update the documentation for environment variables to reflect the new .taskmasterconfig approach. Additionally, ensure the file aligns with the structure and style of .cursor/rules/dev_workflow.mdc and .cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc, and clearly denote the CLI commands as fallback options while emphasizing the improved performance, structured data handling, and error management provided by MCP tools.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the .windsurfrules file displays MCP-based workflow examples as primary and CLI operations as secondary. Test the server restart instructions and MCP configuration steps in a controlled environment. Cross-check the updated environment variable documentation against the migration guide provided in .taskmasterconfig. Finally, validate that the file structure and content align with the reference documents, ensuring consistency and clarity in the transitions from CLI to MCP-based interactions.
