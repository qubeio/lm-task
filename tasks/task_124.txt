# Task ID: 124
# Title: Add unit tests for MCP tool get-tasks
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Expand wrapper tests for mcp-server/src/tools/get-tasks.js to cover execute flow, parameter validation, and error paths.
# Details:
Scope:
- File under tests/unit/mcp/tools/get-tasks.test.js
- Cover: (1) registration: name, parameters; (2) execute happy path delegates to direct function with correct args; (3) handles status and withSubtasks parameters; (4) propagates errors and returns structured failure output.
- Mock direct function module only; avoid deep mocks.
Impact:
- Improves coverage for get-tasks.js (currently single-digit) and ensures stable MCP tool API.

--- Updated 2025-10-03T19:23:15.855Z ---
Implemented wrapper tests for MCP tool get-tasks.
- Files added: tests/unit/mcp/tools/get-tasks.test.js
- Covered: tool registration shape; execute happy path delegating to listTasksDirect with normalized args; error path when findTasksJsonPath fails
- Result: get-tasks.js coverage significantly improved; tests passing

# Test Strategy:
Run npm run test:coverage; expect get-tasks.js line coverage to increase and branches for param handling to be exercised.
