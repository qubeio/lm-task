Product Requirements: NPM Package Publishing

Goal:
Publish a Node.js package to the public NPM registry under a new organization.

User Profile:
The user is a developer but has never published an NPM package before. They require a detailed, step-by-step guide.

Key Features/Tasks:
1.  **Project Initialization**: Ensure the project is a valid Node.js project with a `package.json` file.
2.  **package.json configuration**:
    -   Set the package name, including the organization scope (e.g., `@my-org/my-package`).
    -   Set the version number (e.g., `1.0.0`).
    -   Add a description.
    -   Specify the main entry point file.
    -   Add author information.
    -   Specify the license.
    -   Add keywords for discoverability.
    -   Specify the repository URL.
3.  **NPM Account & CLI Login**:
    -   Ensure the user has an NPM account.
    -   Guide the user to log in to the NPM CLI using `npm login`.
4.  **Code Preparation**:
    -   Ensure the code is clean and ready for publishing.
    -   Create a `.npmignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (like tests, temp files, etc.) from the package. This is similar to `.gitignore`.
5.  **Testing**:
    -   Recommend running tests one last time to ensure everything works.
    -   Recommend using `npm pack` to create a local tarball and test it locally before publishing.
6.  **Publishing**:
    -   Run `npm publish --access public` to publish the package. Explain the `--access public` flag is necessary for scoped packages on a free plan.
7.  **Post-Publishing**:
    -   Verify the package is available on the NPM website.
    -   Explain how to publish new versions (bumping the version in `package.json` and running `npm publish` again).
