# Product Requirements Document (PRD) Template

## Overview

[Provide a high-level overview of your product here. Explain what problem it solves, who it's for, and why it's
valuable.]

## Core Features

[List and describe the main features of your product. For each feature, include:

- What it does
- Why it's important
- How it works at a high level]

## User Experience

[Describe the user journey and experience. Include:

- User personas
- Key user flows
- UI/UX considerations]

## Technical Architecture

[Outline the technical implementation details:

- System components
- Data models
- APIs and integrations
- Infrastructure requirements]

## Development Roadmap

[Break down the development process into phases:

- MVP requirements
- Future enhancements
- Do not think about timelines whatsoever -- all that matters is scope and detailing exactly what needs to be build in
  each phase so it can later be cut up into tasks]

## Logical Dependency Chain

[Define the logical order of development:

- Which features need to be built first (foundation)
- Getting as quickly as possible to something usable/visible front end that works
- Properly pacing and scoping each feature so it is atomic but can also be built upon and improved as development
  approaches]

## Risks and Mitigations

[Identify potential risks and how they'll be addressed:

- Technical challenges
- Figuring out the MVP that we can build upon
- Resource constraints]

## Appendix

[Include any additional information:

- Research findings
- Technical specifications]
