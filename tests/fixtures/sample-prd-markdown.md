# Task Management System PRD

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive task management system that allows users to create,
organize, and track tasks with dependencies, priorities, and collaborative features.

## Core Features

### 1. Task Creation and Management

- **Task Creation**: Users can create tasks with titles, descriptions, and due dates
- **Task Editing**: Full CRUD operations for task management
- **Task Categories**: Organize tasks into customizable categories
- **Priority Levels**: High, Medium, Low priority assignments

### 2. Dependency Management

- **Task Dependencies**: Define prerequisite relationships between tasks
- **Dependency Visualization**: Graphical representation of task relationships
- **Circular Dependency Detection**: Prevent and warn about circular dependencies

### 3. User Interface

- **Dashboard**: Overview of all tasks with filtering and sorting
- **Kanban Board**: Drag-and-drop task management interface
- **Calendar View**: Timeline-based task visualization
- **Mobile Responsive**: Full functionality on mobile devices

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **API**: RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation

### Performance Requirements

- Page load times under 2 seconds
- Support for 1000+ concurrent users
- Real-time updates using WebSockets

### Security Requirements

- HTTPS encryption for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Secure password storage with bcrypt

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Basic Task Management

1. **As a user**, I want to create a new task so that I can track my work
2. **As a user**, I want to edit task details so that I can keep information current
3. **As a user**, I want to delete tasks so that I can remove completed or cancelled work

### Epic 2: Advanced Features

1. **As a user**, I want to set task dependencies so that I can manage complex workflows
2. **As a user**, I want to see a visual representation of dependencies so that I can understand task relationships
3. **As a team lead**, I want to assign tasks to team members so that I can distribute work effectively

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (4 weeks)

- [ ] Basic task CRUD operations
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Simple dashboard interface
- [ ] Database schema setup

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (6 weeks)

- [ ] Dependency management
- [ ] Kanban board interface
- [ ] Real-time updates
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (4 weeks)

- [ ] Calendar integration
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Advanced reporting
- [ ] API documentation

## Success Metrics

| Metric             | Target                          | Measurement      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| User Adoption      | 100 active users in first month | Analytics        |
| Task Creation Rate | 50+ tasks per user per month    | Database metrics |
| User Satisfaction  | 4.5/5 rating                    | User surveys     |
| System Uptime      | 99.9% availability              | Monitoring tools |

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

- **Database Performance**: Large datasets may impact query performance
  - _Mitigation_: Implement proper indexing and query optimization

### Medium Risk

- **User Adoption**: Users may resist changing from existing tools
  - _Mitigation_: Provide migration tools and comprehensive onboarding

### Low Risk

- **Browser Compatibility**: Modern features may not work on older browsers
  - _Mitigation_: Define minimum browser requirements and provide fallbacks

## Appendix

### Code Examples

```javascript
// Example task creation API endpoint
app.post("/api/tasks", async (req, res) => {
  const { title, description, priority, dueDate } = req.body;

  try {
    const task = await prisma.task.create({
      data: {
        title,
        description,
        priority,
        dueDate: new Date(dueDate),
        userId: req.user.id,
      },
    });

    res.status(201).json(task);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```

### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  priority VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'medium',
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
  due_date TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
);

CREATE TABLE task_dependencies (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  task_id INTEGER REFERENCES tasks(id),
  depends_on_id INTEGER REFERENCES tasks(id),
  UNIQUE(task_id, depends_on_id)
);
```

## Conclusion

This task management system will provide a comprehensive solution for individual and team productivity, with a focus on
dependency management and user experience. The phased implementation approach ensures we can deliver value incrementally
while building toward the full vision.
