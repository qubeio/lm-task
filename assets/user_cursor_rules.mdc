# Project Development with LM-Tasker

## ðŸ”„ Project Awareness & Context
- **Always check LM-Tasker tasks** before starting work. Use `lm-tasker list` to see current tasks and `lm-tasker next` to find what to work on.
- **Update task status** as you progress. Mark tasks as `in-progress` when starting and `done` when complete.
- **Log implementation details** in subtasks using `lm-tasker update-subtask --id=<id> --details="..."` to capture what you learn.

## ðŸ§± Code Structure & Best Practices
- **Follow task requirements** as defined in your LM-Tasker tasks. Check task details with `lm-tasker show <id>`.
- **Break down complex work** into subtasks when a task becomes too large or complex.
- **Respect task dependencies** - complete prerequisite tasks before starting dependent ones.

## âœ… Task Completion Workflow
- **Start each session** with `lm-tasker next` to identify the next priority task
- **Mark progress** using `lm-tasker set-status --id=<id> --status=in-progress`
- **Document as you go** with `lm-tasker update-subtask` to capture implementation notes
- **Mark complete** with `lm-tasker set-status --id=<id> --status=done` when finished
- **Add new tasks** discovered during work with `lm-tasker add-task`

## ðŸ“š Documentation & Communication
- **Keep task details current** by updating them as requirements or implementation approaches change
- **Use clear, specific task titles** when adding new tasks
- **Document decisions** in task details, especially when deviating from original plans

## ðŸ§  AI Assistant Guidelines
- **Use LM-Tasker commands** to manage your project workflow and task organization
- **Focus on implementation** rather than task management when the tasks are already well-defined
- **Ask for task clarification** if requirements are unclear before starting implementation
- **Suggest task breakdown** when encountering complex features that need subtasks
